Hello reader!

For this semester of college, 2019/2020 summer semester, I will begin a dating application project. At first I will work alone on one feature before joining up with others to complete it into a fully realised application. This read me has been made to explain to anyone what exactly can be found here and how to navigate my repository. 

(hierneer te zetten voor developers, updaten voor hun, wiki is voor hoe het in elkaar steekt. Basics van project)
